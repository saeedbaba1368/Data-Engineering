<h1> 'there_are_no_gods'_(33) </h1>

    This is the last three parts Answer Sai Sai, who asked for me religious beliefs and opinions that Now sustan.This video serves as general, which essentially covers statements not covered in the previous video, that dealt with concepts that Affirmatively I do not exist.So, to The last two questions: what statements Do you think they are unknowable?and because? Responding to this I want to see various types of evidence and arguments proposed in support of divine statements, along with their inherent problems. 

    I will also elucidate where I come from With the title of this series.First of all Everything, for me to talk about absolute Incognizability, it is a false track.Like Talk about absolute knowledge, I would suggest What to speculate on what we can never know, when we don't know everything that We do not know, it is not the most productive use of our time.I think it is worth more look at what we don't know well and the obstacles that prevent it. 

    Two great obstacles to statements Divine are our definition and methodology. Consider two scenarios in which the task consists in knowing how the other side looks like Moon. In the first, The moon is defined as a flat disc, which floats like a cloud in the air, we have Guess that is about 500 meters high.Although strangely seems to move away as We approach, however we conclude that Feel humans and try to evade us. 

    The second scenario is defined the moon As we know it today.We can see how these different definitions will lead to different methodologies.With the first Definition We cannot approach the Moon For ourselves, so what we can do is, We realize that it does not move when we throw it rocks or fire arrows;we set Design powerful projectiles to turn The moon, of course it will fail.In a second scenario, we use measurements of precision to design a space rocket that takes us safe there ourselves.This achieves it.Both of these experiences are valuable, as success He gave us knowledge, but also of the Failure we learned that our assumptions were wrong.By eliminating our mistakes and corrected our course, Our definitions are increasingly precise, And also our methodology. 

    Now let's imagine a third stage.Let's say We define the moon as a mental projection; an intangible representation of a form of life that lives in another plane of existence, we have ruled out the physical responses in favor of mental ones. We ask the lunar way of life to reveal your distant side of our imagination.People draw What they think communicates the moon them. The drawings do not look anything like each. 

    At this point it would seem sensible Reject this definition.And we can all Understand why, right?As possibly eliminate errors?But people Does not reject this definition.The idea of They were in personal communion with This way of life made them feel special. They claim that their designs are correct, That others are illusuous. They do not have that special connection with Moon.Gravitate to people With similar designs that seem Theirs validate.They teach their to your children that your design is correct. 

    When children try to commune with The moon must also see this image.Yeah No, they are not in contact with the moon Each generation transmits it to the next. Some begin to cover up or destroy other people's designs, saying They are an insult to the moon.Conflict It arises between groups.The weakest groups And less attractive designs, they lose land, and although some of them get maintain a small body of followers, a handful of popular designs come to to dominate.The cause of this whole unnecessary conflict?An erroneous definition. 

    A wrong thought on someone's head on how to explain something in the Universe, and human propensity to to erroneous ideas that make us feel specials, instead of facing these defects, and Find a better idea.There is a important difference, between the idea of a lunar way of life, and the idea of gods. We can see the moon, it is a phenomenon that It exists and requires an explanation.With Gods, there is no evidence that there is something, But it's incredible that It does not seem to import.We still see the same statements of personal knowledge, the same indoctrination of children, and must Unfortunately all the same hostilities. 

    Compared to the first two scenarios, it is Of course something strange is happening here. God's ideas generate multiple contradictory truths, which cannot be all correct.Without a reliable method of eliminate errors, this situation is Desperate.Some argue that they do have justification for their specific deities, So let's see them.In its most basic form We have the bold statement of: I know my gods exist.Without another reason than a sensation of personal connection. 

    The argument fails because if you work for you, It works for everyone.If the knowledge statement personnel of the person ¨a¨ validate Its gods, then a affirmation of personal knowledge of people Of all religions their gods validate.Statements that apply To the entire board, they do not favor any individual, And they can be canceled. So personal conviction is not viable criteria.I once saw the ghost of the dead baby in my basket of dirty clothes. 

    It was the saddest I saw. When I looked back I realized It was a dirty handkerchief.We know the prone to err of the human brain.We know that humans they experience all kinds of unreal events, based on delusional perceptions, deceptive hallucinations, or crisis psychotic caused by various causes, such as stress, duel, drugs or false recognition.We also know that humans experience a great variety of physical sensations.We cool with fear, Let's numb terror, patients with panic, we have excitation bursts.When I was very young, I used to feel that the air was Physically effervescent sometimes.These and Other sensations are well documented Physiological causes.Until the natural explanations can be dismissed, We have no reason to start looking elsewhere, And again, if it works for you, it works for all. 

    Ignorance is a key component of statements miraculous, whether old, Like resurrections.Or the most modern, like that of the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, claim of divine light, when filmed by his cameraman Kevin Millen, and Cochambrosa Casa de Madre Teresa for him dying in Calcutta, it came out brighter than expected.Without Muggeridge knew, Macmillan had simply used a new Kodak movie sensitive to light.With each Miraculous statement, "I can't explain it" magically becomes "you can not explain", that magically becomes "it has been explained.The gods did.The affirmation Rest in the absurd paradoxical Affirmation: "I don't know, Therefore I know "ignorance is not a argument in favor of knowledge.In 1800, in his Book ¨ Washington's life¨, Park Weems transmitted the story of a young George Washington, admitting that he had administered some fatal axes to his father's cherry tree, But there is no evidence that This happened. 

    As many supposed fragments of history, The incident of the cherry tree is considered apocryphal;An invention in this case Designed to inspire children to virtue. People suggest that because I am a Atheist, I reject all religious historical claims but not All non -religious as knowledge. They are doubly erroneous, but discussions are over If the hititas existed or not, The Egyptians drank wine or no, they have nothing to do with about the authenticity of a speaker donkey. 

    No one discusses historical details from Malcolm Muggeridge and his visit to mother Teresa.But those historical ones details do not support their miraculous statement.Magic cannot be smuggled under the protection of historical evidence. Prayers, experiences close to death, The list continues.If conflicting concepts of gods They claim the same justification, Then it is not eliminating errors.Apart of the probative arguments of the existence of gods, several arguments have been proposed based on logic, but I haven't heard any Contain at least one fatal failure. 

    We have the Kalam of multiple defects that falls In his first premise: ¨All what It begins to exist, it has a cause¨.The phrase "It begins to exist" refers to the creation ex Nihilo, creation of nothing.This Contrast with the creation of former matter: Creation from pre -existing matter. The problem of proposing creation from Nothing is that for a cause to be Cause, you have to act on something.To have an effect, there must be something for an effect to occur.There must be a cause that acts on Nothing to produce something is a Magic explanation. 

    When we ask how this God is supposed has created the universe, a word harvest repeatedly: it is said that "quiso " Creation, and this strange statement is presented as if it were explain something.He has not done so. It makes no less sense to talk about ¨ naked the Universe to existence "or" take from it to existence ".Being willing, you have no more established as a mechanism for Creation of matter, that any of these other verbs.Among the deficiencies of transcendental argument in favor of God, is that establishes a false dichotomy between the physical and the conceptual. 

    Argues that because the logical absolute - as the identity law - they have no physical existence, that is to say the laws themselves are composed of material, then they must be conceptual, And if they are conceptual, They require a mind.And that mind is God.May require a mind to formulate The equation ¨A is equal to ", but the type proponents They have not shown that the mind is necessary for an object to be The same as himself.The transcendental argument commits a fallacy of equivocal, by equating human logic With reality.The old man and slippery ontological argument It is presented in various forms. 

    Try to define the existence of a God, defining existence as a quality intrinsic of a God.The arguments are founded on the idea that God would be the greatest possible or perfect, and that that greatness or perfection, would imply existence, since without existence, being would not be like big or perfect.One of the many defects of the ontological argument, it refers to the separable of existence.Existence It is not an additional feature.Without existence, an object does not retain all all His other qualities.When we postulate a god that exists and a God that does not exist, We do not have two gods both omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, etc, oh, but one It has the added characteristic of existing.A God That does not exist is nothing.Existence It is an intrinsic quality of anything that exists.A man, a planet, a painting.Yeah They have existence, they are themselves.Yeah no, nothing.As With probative arguments, these and Other arguments suffer the same problem to be applicable to all kinds of concepts of gods, so that although these arguments would have worked, there is no way From them to specific deities.Not only divine statements generate multiple ticks, They also seek to cover up their crosses, With remarkable consistency. 

    When it comes to something divine, or magical statements that become sufficiently specific within the limits of the known, They fall directly to the known fake.As the Last video showed, exaggerated attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience, which do not allow restrictions or exceptions in Its scope, soon they conflict with other attributes, which depend on those restrictions and exceptions, so, How were these clashes defended?A common strategy It is distorting the definitions.Let's take omni- benevolence against hell.Omni- benevolence raises the concept of benevolence, an attainable quality through humans, to absolute proportions. 

    Implies benevolence towards all things, in everything places, at all times.But what is that benevolence?Some say it is not of mercy, forgiveness, or compassion, but of justice, so they affirm that Punish is not incoherent with this quality, but this twisted definition still does not work. The most abominable human than ever He lived, he only committed finite crimes. It doesn't matter to put the other cheek;for punish someone for eternity, inclines the The balance beyond the mentality eye by eye, Tooth for the tooth there is no justice conceivable in eternal torture. 

    Clearly, hardening the soft side of This combination will not cancel the contradiction, so, how are you address the fire that will never be off.Discuss hell in any open forum, And in the end they will tell you that the whole issue of Eternal torture is wrong. They may tell you that forever it just means a long time.Some turn off everything together, climbing hell to a kingdom of anarchy, or a kind of group therapy, where people contemplate their defects for a time before being forgiven, then taken to some paradise.While these definitions lose everything Semblance of its original meaning, sure, The contradiction disappears, but like the contradiction goes through the door, Unknowability enters through window.No matter how much The existence of hell, its existence is impossible for us establish.How are tests acquired For a destination that requires death as a passport?Without a means of Justification, hell is unknowable. 

    The same applies to other incoherent matches. Yes, how we distort and dilute their definitions, contradictions conceptual leave, but only yield to the underlying problem of Incognizability.We can all imagine fantastic beings. Give them the attributes we want, as specific powers and knowledge, Methods of delivery of the types of justice we want to do, To make an unfair universe seem fair, And without demonstration terrain in reality, nothing more substantial than a stain Creative writing has happened.Other refutable statements are taken to the apparent security of unknowability, through of several reformulations.Old statements of a land immovable, were reviewed to accommodate the initially heliocentric model. 

    Inamovible, if reinterpreted as " of its orbit ", a completely different statement, But as will say, one that still it does not work. The evangelist, Ray Comfort, chooses another tactic.He tells the skeptic "runs out and move the earth;Maybe you and you Friends you can jump on it, or find an outcrop Rocky, and try to push it together.Maybe after That little experiment, you will grant that the earth is immovable. " This argument is as fatuous as suggesting that a apple is immovable, because a fly It cannot raise it.Both defenses fail. 

    Anything is movable of its orbit by adequate mass and time objects, or gravity, or can the land resist holes blacks now?So: Where is this going Immovable land somewhere?It is reformulated as phenomenological, representing experience Human subjective, and joins another Inaccurate descriptions of the universe, Like the sun rushes to return to where leave, but this defense becomes problem when the events described took place before humans existed to perceive them erroneously.But later The last resort comes: from language It is nothing more than a poetic license, similar license Poetics is granted to the Koran story, on ¨The Sun putting on a mourn It becomes "how if you put yourself in a mournful spring." With passages that slide between phenomenological, literal, and metaphorical, and without repairs to add All kinds of ad-hoc qualifications, the potential meaning becomes irremediably plastic.The wider the range of allowed interpretations, more the claims towards unknowability are pushed, covering all possibilities, no statement solid is made.Other types of Changes, of false known To unknown, they come in response to Passages like Mark 16:17: ¨Endo Jesus Declare the signs that must accompany To those who believe.Apart from non -verifiable skills such as expelling demons and acts easily falsifiable as speak in tongues, it is stated that Those who believe, can drink poison Mortal without damage.Other passages are Quickly cited that prohibit such fatal libations because they put God to proof.If a sign of belief can never be demonstrated, in what sense can be then a sign?Some claim that this passage is parabolic, but the parables are stories designed to illustrate some Moral.Where is the story?Where is the Moral?Others claim that this passage is a post hoc;possibly from the second century, I shouldn't even be there.So, Why is it there?Well, try to get it out, and You will find objections of people who look at other standards validity that the details of human authorship, such as the Pentecostal that Diluted strictness in references specific to these verses, although Drink non -lethal doses cover the mortal spirit of the verse, nor does a distinguished believer from The non -believers, which was what the point was about exercise.So, evidence against the gods It pushes into the incogno, becoming unusable through a variety of linguistic reinterpretations, and appeals to the script their prohibitions and disqualificationsMy atheism is basically a null hypothesis: when any positive statement that some process or agent is responsible for a phenomenon, The null hypothesis affirms that It is not the case.In Western judgments, the positive statement is that the person ¨A¨ is guilty, therefore the corresponding void Hypothesis is that the person ¨A¨ is not guilty. 

    The null hypothesis is the Position by default, the position before the test.AND It is the load of the part that makes the positive allegation to provide a Justification to reject that breach. If it were the other way around, the problems They would soon become apparent. In court, it would be presumed guilty.New medications will be presumed effective Without evidence.And each proposal of Being magical will be presumed that it exists default.From elves, to sirens, to all the gods never proposed. 

    So, to the positive statements that exist Gods, I give you the null hypothesis that exist. There are no gods.If someone believes they can Propose a feasible divine theory I am all ears. My loyalty is not naturalism or materialism, As some suggest.My loyalty a systems that demonstrate your statements.I I have no idea how a divine theory Viable would look.And it's not my work to provide it;That is the burden of The proponent.But I know what They would have to do.The gods are examples of What I call: "Beach decapitos", what they settle on our understanding of reality.Separate, not integrated. 

    An effective theory would have to integrate that concept with the universe, which offers verifiable predictions, and base all specific proposals, of the Characteristics of the proposed entities. When demonstrating in practice, I will happily reject my null hypothesis What statements do you think they can be known through personal revelation?What evidence You would accept yourself and why? Use as much as possible that convinces you of some kind of existence of God, who is within culture of things attributable to such revelationsWithin cultural fields, nothing.What we are talking about is Out of cultural kingdoms.The manifestations Miraculous are certainly useless.As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any technology advanced enough, it is indistinguishable from magic. 

    Centuries ago, a great thunderous voice of a Tree could scare the gods in the fog. Today we are probably thinking ¨Oh hidden speakers¨.Let's be clear about The function of revelation: it is not dazzle, or amaze, and it is not for bewilder. The revelation function is to reveal. Improve understanding.What it is presented as supernatural, can integrate into our understanding or can not.If you can't, then it's unknown.Before I talked about the apparent security of unknowability.Is safely in the sense that it is protected from falsification.The problem is, as long as God remains unknowable, the null hypothesis From the atheist remains intact.The only way forward for the concept of God is yes can be integrated into the known, in which case the supernatural is a Provisional term, not permanent.Yeah There are created-universal beings with intentionality, then operate by specific principles defined and Mechanisms. Let us say they are. 

    That is the only type of revelation that I am interested.Something with substantial Informative content. Well, ¨sai sai¨, I appreciate your Questions, I appreciate your comments on the vagueness of the term "lateo". Does not reveal much about him specific individual reasoning, but I hope that in response to your questions precise, I have given you an idea of me Personal position, feel free to answer If you wish, but for now.
