<h1> Transactional_Analysis_3_gimmicks </h1>

    In the previous clip I looked at how TTE modeling for drama and mental games For example, the drama triangle of Stephen Carbman Where the players exchange their dramatic roles Between the victim and the executioner (persecuted) and the savior And the equation of games for Eric Burns Where the two parties can be seen as They take advantage of each other to meet some need Sometimes the T -TB suggests What to do with mental games It is to discover the need of the other person And not to provide them. The truth is that we cannot determine Always the needs of others If some of them are more insulting to you, How can you determine if they are They already believe in the validity of these insults? Or if they know that it is not real And they are only trying to provoke you? Indeed, people, at times, They cannot determine their own needs Because they behave from needs Located outside their awareness I think we might go a lot of time In an attempt to discover [needs] people While there is a more effective strategy It is summarized in trying to understand ourselves If we can know the thing in ourselves, Which drives us to enter the games ... 

    We will never need to know the motives Hidden for the other person The needs of the targeted person are called According to the TA, "tricks or baits" The word "trick or taste" may look like It is a "valuable rule" However, despite the possibility of some tricks From deteriorating behaviors or illusions ... We haven't found it well yet, Tricks can be based on rules Very positive and produced by some groups For example rules such as "Put your confidence in people" do good deeds Within an audience of positive interactors But not within the phasegi. Here is this living example of the "tricks" In a game he called Erik Bern "Schillil," (A) A guest at a party (B) (A) is a drink on a dress (B) that is angry But she holds her nerves, and (A) apologizes (B) is pronounced in a phrase that indicates forgiveness (A) continues to spill the drink, And rhythm and breaking things Then he apologizes for everything he does, (B) appears its page .. 

    About all of this on social apparent But what you feel (B) is a fact that is far from forgiveness They know that these accidents are completely intended, And (a) also knows that she knows that So, if both know What is going on is deliberate Did (B) continue to keep up with this demonstration? Because the motivation is the "bait-trick" (B) It is her need to be "Aqlana" Which can appear in many forms. The general principle may be: "I have to be rational" Or it can be less direct "I have to show rationally." The rule (principle) may be conditional As "I have to show rationally If the other appears to be rational. 

    One of the most powerful variations is the next "I will show that I am rational to show you that I am better than you." Do not suffice (b) in this case By maintaining its balance, It proceeds to prove an order on (a) Whenever he curses the damage (B) got more opportunities to show her superiority. If we look again to ... Burns game "Why don't you, yes but" We talked about in the previous video Where (A) poses a problem (B) introduces a series of solutions But (A) refers to a defect In each of the ideas (b) We can see similar variations as possible Here it seems that (B) a need to be a help, The general principle may be: "I have to be helpless" Or "I have to appear as a certain" Or other similar variations. But what may be attracted (b) already "I can make you feel grateful because I help you." This is a possibility of a very strong taste Because it is completely harmony with the other person Who can in turn respond Under the beneficial psychological situation "Continue what you are doing." Sometimes it is possible to take us completely Where we do not feel that we are the one who begins the game We may think that we are the one who responds to the games In fact, we are the one who incites it (B) note that (a) looks A little compressed, so (A) responds that she feels With a decrease in its morale due to something, But it is fine, so (b) is done Due to his unbridled desire to help By submitting a series of suggestions that She can raise her morale (A) rejects it all. After a while (B) to himself: (A) You play with me, "Why don't you, yes, but" What you want is to get attention only For my negligence, here I am trying to help her! But (A) was not playing that game Rather, she takes responsibility Her feelings And you do not need anything from (b) Who did the game For his need to have a feeling of gratitude The game is used to obtain feelings of feelings Associated with the state of unstable sacrifice If we find ourselves, we practice Specific game or games We can start getting to know our needs By resorting to some sincere self -survey. 

    What do we really seek through the game? What is the perfect imaginative output? Are we looking to earn something? Do we want to avoid something? I seek to consolidate a status or impression What do we want to happen For the other player at the end of the matter Answers to these questions will give us Important signs that lead us to "our tricks/ our bait" Some "tricks/ bait" possess less clear ties With the games you bring "Why don't you, yes," It revolves around "Help" But it can succeed with someone It is not interested in providing assistance at all For example, a person may be used He does not feel relaxed in social situations A stream of suggestions to ease One of the moments of silent silence When we become aware of the exact nature For this trick in a specific game We will have a greater chance In the disintegration of that game As soon as we have a knowledge of "our tricks" We can rely on our thinking to go out This is accountable for wrong assumptions It contains.Or we can act so that we can come out Act in contrast to the need and control it Instead of letting others control it Tricks can come in the form Rules or expressions of request Like the previously mentioned The global style of these rules It is evidence of the problems that tend to create "To be ..." Is it always obligatory To be the same thing? If our goal is to be Example viewing here Not only we will cause disappointment for ourselves Mostly people will appear ... They exploit these expectations Unrealistic And they use it against us in the games they play If we discover that such "messages" You control our leadership We can estimate its realism. Depending on the adjective We are examining We may decide to change it in this way Or this way. Sometimes we carry ideas Like "I must be logical" without being aware Our definition that we use for this word It is a definition of deviation If we dig deeper Inside what we mean when using The word "logical" we may find "messages" as follows: "I have to not show anger" "I have to avoid uncomfortable situations." "I have to keep my personal photo. 

    As a nice person " But what does it mean really To be "logical" Our research in the definition of the word We find things like this -Displaying the logic -Watering to give the correct judgments Is it the right judgment to leave a person? It deliberately continues with the carcinogenic Picking things and breaking them While we pretend to be indifferent and do not say "no" If you know that someone is standing Those things are intended It is "logical" to explain to them You know exactly what they are doing and expel them. 

    And if you are not sure they are doing it On the intention or not You may be ready for noble About a single isolated incident But with the continued damage It is "logical" to ask them The cost of damage If they refuse to pay It is "logical" to ask them to leave. If one of them is already reckoning That is their own responsibility as a mature They can deal with it .. in many ways They can work on it to become less violated Or take preventive measures To avoid situations that may lead to accidents Or can they bear the consequences of their breach They compensate for the damage they cause Either they expect others to bear them And bear all the trouble and the costs that have It is "logical" Sometimes it becomes getting rid of .. 

    Wright forms of words like this And replace it with actual definitions It can prevent games. "Mu'in" is another word that can .. It is overflowing with the dismissed definitive definitions For years (A) grabbed (b) He was not a good friend of her She complains when he invites her to attend places And activities you do not like He must know that she does not like her, Then you complain He does not invite her to the above And now she feels that she has neglected. You complain when he asks (b) About things in her life she does not want to talk about her Then she decided later that she wanted to talk And you complain when he does not ask her (B) about her And throughout the time you remind him That the "real" friend does not do so (B) Waged a losing battle here In the company of (a) That is no longer the true spontaneous person Who knows each other He is now impersonating a role Instead of being a person He hopes to be a "good friend" It is something that he will never be Because the definition of a "good friend" here He is "able to read thoughts" (B) can get out of the game By recovering the possession of the rules And he rejected mysterious fluctuations For the expectations imposed by (a) About what determines being a good friend And to define himself What is acceptable behavior from the friend If we know our actions that "our tricks" We can not act in that way If you need harmony It leads you to preserve peace in your family Try not to do so Let others solve their differences In the end, if they do not have a skill Dealing with some of them What will they do if you are not present.
