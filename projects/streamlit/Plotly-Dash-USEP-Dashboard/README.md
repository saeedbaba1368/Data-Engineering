# Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) and Demand Forecast Dashboard (Plotly Dash)

### BUSINESS CHALLENGE  

Develop a Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) forecasting model that takes into account of historical correlations among multi-dimensional data sets, and system information (e.g., unit maintenance projection), employing innovative ways in applying AI (e.g. NLP/NLG + predictive analytics) to improve accuracy of forecasts.  

In this project, a Market Information Dashboard including multiple interactive charts, tables and analytical market commentary was developed to visualize the forecast and demand data. Plotly Dash was utilized to build this dashboard.
